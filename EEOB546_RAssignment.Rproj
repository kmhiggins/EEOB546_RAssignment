This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
##read in files 

fang <- read.table("C:/Users/kmjoh/Desktop/BCB546-Spring2021/assignments/R_Assignment/fang_et_al_genotypes.txt", header = T)

snp <- read.table("C:/Users/kmjoh/Desktop/BCB546-Spring2021/assignments/R_Assignment/snp_position.txt", sep = "\t", header = T)
```


```{r}
##Data investigation
##can see column counts and row counts in data summary window but can use the following if unsure
dim(fang)
dim(snp)

##see head and tail of dataframes
head(fang)
tail(fang)
head(snp)
tail(snp)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
