# EEOB546_RAssignment


In this repository you will find an R markdown notebook with the code to replicate the maize, teosinte, and image files generated from fang_et_al_genotypes.txt and snp_position.txt

There are maize and teosinte files that have the combined information from the two previously mentioned .txt files in both ascending order of snps and descending order of snps, with ascending having "?" in place of missing values, and the descending having "-" in place of missing values. 

I further created image files showing the density of snps along the chromosomes, and the heterozygosity, normalized heterozygosity vs missing data, and a dot plot of snp locations on chromosomes.
